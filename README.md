# Build "Event-in-a-Box"
Build is for developers by developers. As developers come together to help the world solve new challenges, sharing knowledge and staying connected is more important than ever. Join your community to learn, connect, and code—to expand your skillset today, and innovate for tomorrow.

This repo contains creative and technical content for running Build local event or watch party in your community as well as information on how to syndicate the broadcast on your own sites. Each year is a little different and there is a lot of technical content associated with the events each time so we've preserved them in folders by year.
