# Build Content from the .NET Team

Build is for developers by developers. As developers come together to help the world solve new challenges, sharing knowledge and staying connected is more important than ever. Join your community to learn, connect, and codeï¿½to expand your skillset today, and innovate for tomorrow.

This repo contains the .NET-related presentations, slides, and code from Build. Each year is a little different and there is a lot of technical content associated with the events each time so we've preserved them in folders by year.
